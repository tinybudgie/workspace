# What is it about?

Hello, I'm Tema. In this documentation, I will save all my experience in programming backend applications. I mainly use NestJS and most of the articles are related to this framework, but there are also many useful architectural solutions that can be used in any programming language.

## About me

I have been developing different levels backend systems since 2020. Almost all of these projects are made with NodeJS (and NestJS) and a lot of these projects use blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.

I have experience with:

- Solidity and smart-contract development
- NodeJS/TypeScript
- NestJS
- Blockchain technologies like Ethereum, Avalanche, Polkadot, EOS.
- Docker
- Brokers like RabbitMQ

This will describe the problems that I encountered during development, as well as the solutions that I came up with. In these articles you can also find information from other sites that I take if I find it very useful. I will always try to link to sources.

If any documentation seems strange or incorrect to you, or you have suggestions, you can text me on Telegram **@temarusanov**
